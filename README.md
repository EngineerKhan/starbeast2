# StarBEAST2

StarBEAST2 is a new method for multispecies coalescent inference of species
trees and other phylogenetic parameters. It is approximately 6 to 7 times faster
than *BEAST, the method it replaces. It also introduces species tree relaxed
clocks, which apply a separate substitution rate to each branch of the species
tree. This enables accurate estimates of between-species molecular clock rates.
