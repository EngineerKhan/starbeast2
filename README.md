# StarBEAST2

StarBEAST2 is a new method for multispecies coalescent inference of species
trees and other phylogenetic parameters. It is approximately 6 times faster
than *BEAST, the method it replaces. It also introduces species tree relaxed
clocks, which apply a separate substitution rate to each branch of the species
tree. This enables accurate estimates of between-species molecular clock rates.

There are two tutorials available for StarBEAST2. The first tutorial
demonstrates how to infer
[species trees with relaxed clocks](https://github.com/genomescale/starbeast2/releases/download/v0.13.0/StarBEAST2-tutorial-1.pdf).
The second tutorial, which should only be attempted after the first one,
demonstrates how to infer
[calibrated trees](https://github.com/genomescale/starbeast2/releases/download/v0.13.0/StarBEAST2-tutorial-2.pdf)
with speciation times in millions of years using node priors.
